# Project Agents.md Guide for agent

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance  
for AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Structure for agent Navigation

- `/cmake`: project generation scripts including CUDA library detection and setup, compiler flags and os
- `/include/fused_kernel`: Source code that agents should analyze
  - `/algorithms/basic_ops`:  basic arithmetic operations
   - `/algorithms/image_processing`:  serveral image processing operations  inclusing interpolation, warping, color conversion among others
  `/tests`: standard Test files that agent should maintain and extend
  `/utests`: Unit Test files that agent should maintain and extend
## Coding Conventions for agents

### General Conventions for Agents.md Implementation

- Use c++ for all new code generated by agent
- Agent should follow the existing code style in each file
- Agents.md requires meaningful variable and function names in  output
- agent should add comments for complex logic as guided by Agents.md

### CUDA Components Guidelines for agent

- Agent should use functional components with hooks as specified in Agents.md
- Keep components generated by Agent small and focused
- Agents.md requires proper prop typing in all agent component code
- Agent must follow the file naming convention: PascalCase.cu

## Build and Test Requirements for Agents

### Before Committing Changes

1. **Build the Project:**
   - Ensure the project builds successfully using the following command:
     ```bash
     cmake --build . --config Release
     ```

2. **Run All Tests:**
   - Execute all tests to verify that the changes do not break existing functionality:
     ```bash
     ctest --output-on-failure
     ```

## Pull Request Guidelines for agent

When agent helps create a PR, please ensure it:

1. Includes a clear description of the changes as guided by Agents.md
2. References any related issues that agent is addressing
3. Ensures all tests pass for code generated by agent
4. Keeps PRs focused on a single concern as specified in Agents.md

## Programmatic Checks for agent

Before submitting changes generated by agent, run:

```bash
# Lint check for agent code

# Type check for agent TypeScript

# Build check for agent implementations
cmake --build . --config Release

# Run all tests
ctest --output-on-failure
```

All checks must pass before agent generated code can be merged. Agents.md helps ensure agent follows these requirements.
